# request

Please create a python program to validate a Zoom webhook. See this documentation for details:
Zoom requires that you manually trigger webhook validation when you add a new webhook or make changes to an existing one. Subsequently, Zoom automatically revalidates webhooks every 72 hours.

Zoom uses a challenge-response check (CRC) for webhook validation. When a CRC occurs, Zoom makes a POST request to your endpoint with a challenge request body. After your endpoint receives the request, your app needs to respond with the challenge response within 3 seconds.

To trigger the initial CRC validation, click Validate under the Event Notification Endpoint URL on the Feature page for your app. See Revalidation for revalidation details.

Zoom webhook validate
You won't be able to save your changes until after Zoom validates your endpoint.

See the following steps to implement the challenge-response check flow.

Receive the challenge (webhook request body)
The webhook request body includes the following properties:

Key	Value Type	Value Description
event	string	The type of the webhook event, which will be "endpoint.url_validation"
payload	object	Contains a property with the plainToken value, the string to hash.
event_ts	number	The timestamp of the webhook event.
Here's an example:

{
  "payload": {
    "plainToken": "qgg8vlvZRS6UYooatFL8Aw"
  },
  "event_ts": 1654503849680,
  "event": "endpoint.url_validation"
}
Hash the plainToken
Once you receive the request body, create a HMAC SHA-256 hash. Set your webhook's secret token as the secret (salt), and the plainToken value as the string to hash. Output in hex format.

Create the response JSON object
Create a JSON object with a key of "plainToken" with a value of the plainToken from the request body, and a key of "encryptedToken" with a value of the hashed plainToken. For example:

{
  "plainToken": "qgg8vlvZRS6UYooatFL8Aw",
  "encryptedToken": "23a89b634c017e5364a1c8d9c8ea909b60dd5599e2bb04bb1558d9c3a121faa5"
}
Respond with the response JSON object
Respond with the response JSON within 3 seconds with a 200 or 204 HTTP response code.

When Zoom successfully validates the challenge response from your webhook endpoint URL, you'll see a validated message under the Event Notification Endpoint URL. If validation fails, you'll see a failed to validate message. Once you successfully complete validation, click Save.

# response

Based on the information given, below is a simple Flask application that can validate a Zoom webhook. We use the `hashlib` Python library to create the HMAC SHA-256 hash, as described.

Please replace `YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the actual secret token of your webhook.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import hashlib
import hmac
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET" # replace with your actual secret

@app.route('/zoom-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def validate_webhook():
    # Parse the incoming JSON request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Ensure the request is a CRC validation
    if data['event'] != 'endpoint.url_validation':
        return 'Unexpected event type', 400

    # Get the plain token from the request
    plain_token = data['payload']['plainToken']

    # Create the HMAC SHA-256 hash
    hash_obj = hmac.new(YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode('utf-8'), 
                        plain_token.encode('utf-8'), 
                        hashlib.sha256)
    encrypted_token = hash_obj.hexdigest()

    # Create the response JSON object
    response = {
        'plainToken': plain_token,
        'encryptedToken': encrypted_token
    }

    # Respond within 3 seconds with a 200 or 204 HTTP response code.
    return jsonify(response), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=8000)
```

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and does not include error handling, logging, or more complex functionality that might be necessary for a production-level application. It's also worth noting that Flask's built-in server is not suitable for production as it doesn't scale well and doesn't easily support SSL, so in a production environment you would want to use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.

# request

How would I run this in heroku?

# response

To run this on Heroku, you need to do the following steps:

1. **Install the Heroku CLI**: You can download it from the [Heroku website](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). After installation, you can use the `heroku` command from your command shell. You will need to log in using the email address and password you used when creating your Heroku account.

2. **Prepare your application for Heroku**: Here are the steps to prepare your Flask application to be deployed on Heroku:

    a. **Create a requirements.txt file**: This file tells Heroku which Python packages it needs to install for your application. In this case, it would look like:

    ```
    Flask==1.1.2
    gunicorn==20.1.0
    ```

    You can generate this file automatically by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

    b. **Create a Procfile**: This file tells Heroku how to run your application. It should contain the following line:

    ```
    web: gunicorn app:app
    ```

    Here, `app` refers to the Python file (`app.py`) and the Flask web application instance (`app = Flask(__name__)`). Make sure your python script is named as `app.py`.

    c. **Configure your Secret Token as an Environment Variable**: In your python script, replace `YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with `os.getenv("YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET")`. Then add the following import at the top:

    ```python
    import os
    ```

    This change makes the script get your secret from the environment variable `YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. You'll set this environment variable on Heroku in the next steps.

3. **Deploy your application on Heroku**: Once your application is prepared, use the following commands to deploy it:

    a. Navigate to your project directory using `cd`.

    b. Initialize a new git repository with the following commands:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

    c. Create a new Heroku application:

    ```bash
    heroku create
    ```

    d. Set the `YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable on Heroku:

    ```bash
    heroku config:set YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=youractualwebhooksecret
    ```

    e. Push your code to Heroku:

    ```bash
    git push heroku master
    ```

4. **Open your application**: You can open your application by running `heroku open`, or by visiting the application URL that Heroku returned when you created the new app.

You have now deployed your Zoom webhook validator to Heroku. It is listening for POST requests at the path `/zoom-webhook` on your application's domain.

# request

I get the following error when trying to run on heroku: from jinja2 import escape
ImportError: cannot import name 'escape' from 'jinja2' (/app/.heroku/python/lib/python3.11/site-packages/jinja2/__init__.py)

# response

The error message you're encountering is typically caused by an incompatibility between the versions of Flask and Jinja2 in your project. 

Flask relies on the Jinja2 library for its templating, and in this case it seems that Flask is trying to import the `escape` function from Jinja2, which may not exist in the version of Jinja2 you're currently using.

To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that your `requirements.txt` file specifies compatible versions of Flask and Jinja2.

Try adding the Jinja2 version into your `requirements.txt` file:

```python
Flask==1.1.2
gunicorn==20.1.0
Jinja2==2.11.3
```

Then, push these changes to Heroku:

```bash
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Update Jinja2 version"
git push heroku master
```

Heroku should install the correct versions of Flask and Jinja2 when it builds your app, which should resolve the ImportError you're seeing.

Please replace the versions above with the versions you are using or intend to use. This is just an example. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Flask 1.1.2 and Jinja2 2.11.3 are compatible.

If you don't specifically need these versions, I would recommend using the latest stable releases of Flask and Jinja2 to take advantage of any recent bug fixes or improvements. If you're not sure which version to use, you can check the Flask and Jinja2 release notes or their respective PyPI pages.

# request

Can you add a function to output the webhook to the log?

# response

Sure, to output the webhook data to the logs, you can use the built-in `logging` module in Python. Let's add it to the existing Flask application.

Here's how to modify your Flask application to log the webhook data:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import hashlib
import hmac
import os
import logging

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv("YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET")

@app.route('/zoom-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def validate_webhook():
    # Parse the incoming JSON request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Log the incoming webhook data
    app.logger.info(f"Received data: {data}")

    # Ensure the request is a CRC validation
    if data['event'] != 'endpoint.url_validation':
        return 'Unexpected event type', 400

    # Get the plain token from the request
    plain_token = data['payload']['plainToken']

    # Create the HMAC SHA-256 hash
    hash_obj = hmac.new(YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode('utf-8'), 
                        plain_token.encode('utf-8'), 
                        hashlib.sha256)
    encrypted_token = hash_obj.hexdigest()

    # Create the response JSON object
    response = {
        'plainToken': plain_token,
        'encryptedToken': encrypted_token
    }

    # Respond within 3 seconds with a 200 or 204 HTTP response code.
    return jsonify(response), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=8000)
```

In this script, `app.logger.info(f"Received data: {data}")` logs the incoming webhook data.

This will output the logs to your console. If you're using Heroku, you can view these logs by running `heroku logs --tail` from your command line.

Just a note that logging sensitive data (like tokens or passwords) can be a security risk. So, be sure to review any log data to ensure you're not unintentionally exposing sensitive information.

# request

Can you modify this so that it prints the webhook data to the local console instead of the log?

# response

Certainly, you can use Python's built-in `print` function to output the webhook data to the console. 

Here's the modified Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import hashlib
import hmac
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv("YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET")

@app.route('/zoom-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def validate_webhook():
    # Parse the incoming JSON request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Print the incoming webhook data to the console
    print(f"Received data: {data}")

    # Ensure the request is a CRC validation
    if data['event'] != 'endpoint.url_validation':
        return 'Unexpected event type', 400

    # Get the plain token from the request
    plain_token = data['payload']['plainToken']

    # Create the HMAC SHA-256 hash
    hash_obj = hmac.new(YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode('utf-8'), 
                        plain_token.encode('utf-8'), 
                        hashlib.sha256)
    encrypted_token = hash_obj.hexdigest()

    # Create the response JSON object
    response = {
        'plainToken': plain_token,
        'encryptedToken': encrypted_token
    }

    # Respond within 3 seconds with a 200 or 204 HTTP response code.
    return jsonify(response), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=8000)
```

In this script, `print(f"Received data: {data}")` prints the incoming webhook data to the console.

Please note that if you're running this application on Heroku, `print` statements won't appear in your local console, but they will appear in Heroku's log output, which you can view with the `heroku logs --tail` command.

Also, be aware that printing sensitive data (like tokens or passwords) to the console can be a security risk. Be sure to review any console output to ensure you're not unintentionally exposing sensitive information.

# request

Can you change this so that it saves the webhook data in a database?

# response

Certainly, you can use a database to store the incoming webhook data. For simplicity, I'll demonstrate how to do this using SQLite, a lightweight disk-based database that's included with Python. However, for a real production app, you'd probably want to use a more robust database system like PostgreSQL, especially if you're hosting your app on a platform like Heroku.

We will also use the `sqlalchemy` and `flask-sqlalchemy` packages to interact with the database. You will need to add these to your `requirements.txt`.

Here's an example Flask app that stores the incoming webhook data to a SQLite database:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import hashlib
import hmac
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv("YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET")

class WebhookData(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    data = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)

@app.route('/zoom-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def validate_webhook():
    # Parse the incoming JSON request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Store the incoming webhook data to the database
    webhook_data = WebhookData(data=str(data))
    db.session.add(webhook_data)
    db.session.commit()

    # Ensure the request is a CRC validation
    if data['event'] != 'endpoint.url_validation':
        return 'Unexpected event type', 400

    # Get the plain token from the request
    plain_token = data['payload']['plainToken']

    # Create the HMAC SHA-256 hash
    hash_obj = hmac.new(YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode('utf-8'), 
                        plain_token.encode('utf-8'), 
                        hashlib.sha256)
    encrypted_token = hash_obj.hexdigest()

    # Create the response JSON object
    response = {
        'plainToken': plain_token,
        'encryptedToken': encrypted_token
    }

    # Respond within 3 seconds with a 200 or 204 HTTP response code.
    return jsonify(response), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()  # create the database table
    app.run(port=8000)
```

In this script, a new `WebhookData` instance is created for each incoming webhook request, and the request data is stored in the database.

Please note that storing data in a database, especially sensitive data like tokens or passwords, must be done in a secure and compliant manner. Be sure to review any data you're storing to ensure you're not unintentionally exposing sensitive information or violating any data privacy laws or regulations.

# request

How would you change this to store the webhook data securely on heroku?

# response

If you want to use a database to store your webhook data securely on Heroku, I would recommend using a PostgreSQL database due to its integration and compatibility with Heroku. You can add a PostgreSQL database to your Heroku app using the Heroku Postgres add-on.

Here's a brief guide on how to get started:

1. Provision the Heroku Postgres add-on from your app's Resources tab in the Heroku dashboard, or from the command line with `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`, which creates a free PostgreSQL database.

2. Heroku automatically sets a `DATABASE_URL` config var for your app, which contains the database URL that SQLAlchemy will use to connect to your database.

3. Update your Flask application to use this database URL, and make sure you're using the `psycopg2` library for PostgreSQL compatibility.

4. To secure the data, you can hash or encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the database.

Here's how your Flask application might look after these changes:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import hashlib
import hmac
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv("YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET")

class WebhookData(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    data = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)

@app.route('/zoom-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def validate_webhook():
    # Parse the incoming JSON request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Secure the incoming webhook data: for example, here we're hashing it
    secured_data = hashlib.sha256(str(data).encode()).hexdigest()

    # Store the secured webhook data to the database
    webhook_data = WebhookData(data=secured_data)
    db.session.add(webhook_data)
    db.session.commit()

    # Ensure the request is a CRC validation
    if data['event'] != 'endpoint.url_validation':
        return 'Unexpected event type', 400

    # Get the plain token from the request
    plain_token = data['payload']['plainToken']

    # Create the HMAC SHA-256 hash
    hash_obj = hmac.new(YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode('utf-8'), 
                        plain_token.encode('utf-8'), 
                        hashlib.sha256)
    encrypted_token = hash_obj.hexdigest()

    # Create the response JSON object
    response = {
        'plainToken': plain_token,
        'encryptedToken': encrypted_token
    }

    # Respond within 3 seconds with a 200 or 204 HTTP response code.
    return jsonify(response), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()  # create the database table
    app.run(port=8000)
```

You need to include the following in your `requirements.txt` file:

```
Flask==1.1.2
gunicorn==20.1.0
psycopg2-binary==2.9.1
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
```

Please replace the versions above with the versions you are using or intend to use. This is just an example.

Remember to commit these changes and push them to Heroku with `git push heroku master`. Your application will automatically connect to the PostgreSQL database and store the webhook data there.

Please note that you should not store sensitive data like personal identifiable information or sensitive business information without proper security measures. If you're not sure how to handle this data, you should consult with a security expert.

# request

How do you read the secured data in the database?

# response

To read the secured data in the database, you can create an endpoint that fetches the data and returns it. However, please keep in mind that this could potentially expose your secured data, which might not be desirable in a production setting. For the purpose of the example, I'll create an endpoint that returns all records in the `WebhookData` table.

Additionally, the data stored in the database is secured (hashed in this example), so you won't be able to restore the original data from the hash. If you need the original data, you'd need to store it in a way that allows for decryption (like symmetric or asymmetric encryption), which is beyond the scope of this example. Please consult with a security expert before handling sensitive data.

Here is a `/data` endpoint that fetches all records from the `WebhookData` table:

```python
@app.route('/data', methods=['GET'])
def get_data():
    # Fetch all records from the WebhookData table
    all_data = WebhookData.query.all()

    # Prepare the data for JSON serialization
    result = [{"id": item.id, "data": item.data} for item in all_data]

    return jsonify(result)
```

To get the data, you can make a `GET` request to `your-heroku-app-url/data`.

Again, I must stress that creating an endpoint that exposes your secured data could be a significant security risk, especially if you're handling sensitive data. Be sure to review your application's security measures before exposing any data through your API.

# request

Change the program so it does not hash the data stored in the database.

# response

If you wish to store the data in its original form, you can simply remove the hashing step and store the `data` directly. Here is how the updated Flask application might look:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import hashlib
import hmac
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET = os.getenv("YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET")

class WebhookData(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    data = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)

@app.route('/zoom-webhook', methods=['POST'])
def validate_webhook():
    # Parse the incoming JSON request
    data = request.get_json()

    # Store the incoming webhook data to the database
    webhook_data = WebhookData(data=str(data))
    db.session.add(webhook_data)
    db.session.commit()

    # Ensure the request is a CRC validation
    if data['event'] != 'endpoint.url_validation':
        return 'Unexpected event type', 400

    # Get the plain token from the request
    plain_token = data['payload']['plainToken']

    # Create the HMAC SHA-256 hash
    hash_obj = hmac.new(YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode('utf-8'), 
                        plain_token.encode('utf-8'), 
                        hashlib.sha256)
    encrypted_token = hash_obj.hexdigest()

    # Create the response JSON object
    response = {
        'plainToken': plain_token,
        'encryptedToken': encrypted_token
    }

    # Respond within 3 seconds with a 200 or 204 HTTP response code.
    return jsonify(response), 200

@app.route('/data', methods=['GET'])
def get_data():
    # Fetch all records from the WebhookData table
    all_data = WebhookData.query.all()

    # Prepare the data for JSON serialization
    result = [{"id": item.id, "data": item.data} for item in all_data]

    return jsonify(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()  # create the database table
    app.run(port=8000)
```

In this script, we're storing the raw data as received from the request and directly saving it into the database. The `/data` endpoint will fetch all records from the `WebhookData` table in the database and return them as a JSON response.

Please keep in mind that storing raw data, especially sensitive data like personal identifiable information or sensitive business information, should be done with proper security measures. Always ensure that your application is secure and follows all necessary data privacy laws and regulations.

# END
